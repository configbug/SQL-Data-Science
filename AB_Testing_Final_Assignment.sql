-- QUESTION 1 : Compare the final_assignments_qa table to the assignment events we captured for 
-- user_level_testing. Write an answer to the following question: Does this table have everything 
-- you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?
-- ANSWER : No. The created_at date is needed.

SELECT * 
FROM dsv1069.final_assignments_qa;

-- QUESTION 2 : Write a query and table creation statement to make final_assignments_qa look like 
-- the final_assignments table. If you discovered something missing in part 1, you may fill in the 
-- value with a place holder of the appropriate data type. 
-- ANSWER :

-- QUESTION 6 : Use Modeâ€™s Report builder feature to write up the test. Your write-up should include a title, a graph for each of the two binary metrics youâ€™ve calculated. The lift and p-value (from the AB test calculator) for each of the two metrics, and a complete sentence to interpret the significance of each of the results.
-- ANSWER :

-- Binary View
-- It can be said with 95% confidence that the elevation value is 2% and the p-value is 0.2. 
-- There is no significant difference in the number of visits within 30 days after the assigned 
-- treatment date between both treatments.

-- Binary Order
-- There are no changes to this metric. The p-value is 0.86 which means that there is no difference
-- in the number of requests within 30 days of the assigned treatment date between both treatments.
